# Neural Network and Machine Learning

## Project Overview:

In this project we help a the business team of a company named `Alphabet Soup` create a binary classifier. A Binary classifier capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We are given a CSV file with more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from them over time. The dataset provides important metadata about each organization that we will use to complete our project.


## Data:

Provided CSV file of past funding (charity_funding.csv)

* EIN and NAME—Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
* USE_CASE—Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* STATUS—Active status
* INCOME_AMT—Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

## Methodology:

1. Pre-process the Data for a Neural Network Model
2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Optimize the Model
