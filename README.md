## Project Overview:

In this project we help a the business team of a company named `Alphabet Soup` create a binary classifier. One with the ability to predict whether the investment applicants will be successful if funded. We are given a CSV file with more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over time. The dataset provides important metadata about each organization that we will use to complete our task.
